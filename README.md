jasper-command-line
===================

Print a jasper document via the command line

**Disclaimer**: This is almost completely based on the great work by [Fortes InformÃ¡tica](https://github.com/fortesinformatica), with the gem [jasper-rails](https://github.com/fortesinformatica/jasper-rails). I built this out of  necessity for a project that wouldn't run [jasper-rails](https://github.com/fortesinformatica/jasper-rails) on top of Ubuntu + nginx + Passenger.

This gem embeds the .jar files provided by [jasper-rails](https://github.com/fortesinformatica/jasper-rails), so you don't need to include the gem ([jasper-rails](https://github.com/fortesinformatica/jasper-rails) requires the whole Ruby on Rails framework, which isn't necessary in this case).

## Dependencies

* You need a Java Virtual Machine installed and set up in order to use this gem.
* [rjb](http://rjb.rubyforge.org/) >= 1.4.0
* [builder](https://rubygems.org/gems/builder) >= 3.0.3
* [activesupport](https://rubygems.org/gems/activesupport) >= 3.2.0

## Install

```
gem install jasper-command-line
```

## Configure

If invoking jasper-command-line via a Rails project, you might need to add `jasper-command-line` to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "jasper-command-line"
```

## Using jasper-command-line
